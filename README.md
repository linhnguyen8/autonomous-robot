# autonomous-robot
This was my final project for my class **[2.678: Electronics for Mechanical Systems](https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/course-2678-electronics-mechanical-systems/)**

Each team was given a robot with stepper motor drivers and was given the task to design a program for a line-following robot to drive autonomously around a track with various line widths, sharp corners, and infinite loops. My partner and I decided to program the Arduino on our robot using PID controller design in order for our robot to be modular and be able to handle any track, not just the track provided to us.
